# Past Life

The title of the game "Past-Life" captures both the mechanics of the game, and how we met the theme. In the game you control a character who must reach a flag at the end of each level. You can kill yourself in order to unleash a power. Each power changes the level in some way. When you are re-born, you can take advantage of the change that your past life made. Use the arrow keys to move, tab to cycle through your powers, and space to use a power.

* [Flixel](https://github.com/AdamAtomic/flixel) - a free Actionscript (Flash) library that I distilled from a variety of Flash games that I've worked on over the last couple years, including Gravity Hook, Fathom and Canabalt.  It's primary function is to provide some useful base classes that you can extend to make your own game objects.
